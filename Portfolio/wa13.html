	There is one very obvious thing about the new President of the United States that nobody has been talking about. Something that apparently has been swept under the rug. Higher ups, Wall Street tycoons, congress, and people everywhere have chosen to ignore the most obvious Presidential scandal that is right in front of their eyes.

	It is clear that since President Joe Biden's first day in office he has had only one clear goal on his mind... to raise the price of Dogecoin. Before he was in office the price of Dogecoin was laughably low. Biden obviously saw this as an oppurtunity to make a large amount of cash. According to my sources back in 2018 Biden bought a large amount of Dogecoin and then created the idea of running for office strictly to raise Dogecoins price.

	While in office he has done nothing but enact policy to raise the price of the doge. As you can see by this graph below Biden is the clear difference between Dogecoin being worth nothing and now at about 40 cents. The only clear cause of this massive price jump must be Biden's election.

	There is a massive price jump that is undeniably from Biden. Let's now look at this second graph that shows the average price of Dogecoin before Biden being sworn into office and after. It is important to bear in mind that the following plots do not share the same y-axis. That's right there was about a 10x jump in average price since the election of Biden.

	Does this seem suspicious? Could there seriously be any other possible explanation for why the price of Dogecoin jumped so much? Could it be because of the tweets of Elon Musk, or the massive increase in talk about it on social media? Definitely not. Obviously it has to be the President's doing. Thanks Obama.
