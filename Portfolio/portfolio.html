<h3>How have Boulder County leaders handled COVID-19 on Twitter?</h3>
<p>In my largest project to date I collected all of the tweets from 15 different Boulder related Twitter accounts from all of 2020, used natural language processing tools to determine how often each account talked about COVID-19, and then determined how this information correlated to increasing COVID cases over time.</p>

<h3>COVID-19: The Media & Stock Market</h3>
<p>In this project that I created in April of 2020 I analyzed how stocks had been effected from covid using the yahoo finance api. Additionally, I looked at the media, using Beautiful Soup to scrape news data and analyze how many times covid related terms were used in news headlines from February to April. I also used NLP to analyze how similar the news articles were to each other and I found that news articles got progressively more similar as covid cases rose. Below is a graph that shows how stocks fell from their original stock price at the beginning of the year due to the covid chaos.</p>
