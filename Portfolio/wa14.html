	<h3>Presenting Data to Different Audiences</h3>

	Presenting information, and more specifically data, is a very tricky thing. There are countless ways to do it for countless audiences.

	Let's first think about if I were to present my findings from my TV show data analysis to a group of other students on campus. To best do this I would probably create a set of interactive vega/altair plots that would allow the user to intereact with the data. I would embed these visualizations on a webpage so they could easily visit the page or share it with their friends. This medium is a good choice because it allows the user to explore the dataset in whichever way they find most interesting. This effectively allows people to be more curious about the data and want to know more about it rather than just a static image would. They could truly explore why the TV show I chose was interesting.

	In our second scenario let's imagine I am sharing information to a coding development team about my TV show. In this scenario I would share my .ipynb file for the developers to load the notebook themselves because they most likely have experience with jupyter notebooks. I would want to make sure I share my code and briefly walk through what I did so they understand the code. I would do this by doing extensive documentation on the notebook. I would use the Markdown tips that we learned at the beginning of this course to ensure the notebook is very informative and properly walks through why the TV show is interesting. This medium is important because it allows the developers to get their hands dirty with the data and code if they choose to.

	In our third scenario let's imagine I am giving a class presentation about my findings about which TV show is the best. In this situation, I would create a reveal.js project to demonstrate my findings. With this reveal.js deck I could walk through slide by slide my project, my goal, my code, my visualizations, and my findings. This deck would allow me to present everything I need to my class all in one efficient and convenient location. This medium allows all types of people to pay attention and follow the project's journey.

	This class taught me many ways on how to present data to different audiences. I learned a lot about different mediums, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Going forward I will think critically about choosing the right medium to explain information to the right audience.
