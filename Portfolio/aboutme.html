	<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I am a current Junior at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Information Science and pursuing minors in Economics and Leadership Studies. With my Information Science education I have been gaining valuable skills in Python and Data Analysis. As well as more specialized skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization. 
</p>

 <p>
 	I worked with a Machine Learning startup, BoozeMapp, helping to pitch to investors and create working prototypes of our system. Through this, I gained a working knowledge of the startup world and what it takes to succeed. This experience cemented my passion for entrepreneurship. 

 </p>

 <p>
 	I have a specialization in E-commerce. As a senior in high school I created and ran (still currently running) an Independent Seller account on Amazon. I buy and sell used books on Amazon, determining optimal pricing and shipping all books myself. I have listed and sold over a 1000 different books and have learned the foundations for what it takes to succeed in E-commerce. 
 </p>


 <p>
 	I am a self-taught IOS developer. I am always looking to do contract work creating peopleâ€™s apps. I have helped to build an app to help photographers determine the optimal composition of their photographs. 
 </p>

<p>
	As a motivated individual who is always seeking to learn any new skill I can, I welcome any new opportunities and challenges that may come my way.
