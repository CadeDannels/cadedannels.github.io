<h1>South Park</h1>

<p>
	South Park is a TV show that has been around for decades now. It presents a lot of controversial topics in real life and uses its many different and unique characters to acheive this.
</p>

<p>
	As visualized by the graphic, South Park has only 3 characters who speak more than 2% of the dialogue in the show. These three characters are Cartman (16%), Kyle (7.8%), and Stan (8.5%). This adds up to less than 33%. Less than a third of the show's dialogue comes from its 3 main characters.
</p>

<p>
	This means that the rest of the 67% of the dialogue is spoken by many, many different characters who all play a small role. South Park has so many recognizable characters who appear at different times in the show to explore different themes. 
</p>

<p>
	This is what makes South Park so able to explore real life events. They have characters who represent all types of people and demographics in the world. As a satirical show this is a huge benefit because it allows them to create truly unique episodes.
</p>

<p>
	In order for a TV show to successfuly air for 23 seasons the show must be able to explore a wide variety of topics with many characters. South Park has mastered this craft. Having dozens of characters who only speak around 1% of the show dialogue but still being recognizable is remarkable. This fact has allowed South Park to become the cultural phenomenon it is.
