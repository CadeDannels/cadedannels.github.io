                  I am a current Senior at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Information Science and pursuing 
                  minors in Economics and Business. With my Information Science 
                  education I have been gaining valuable skills across the tech industry such as 
                  UX design, data analysis, product management, and software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the past year I have been working with the User Experience Research & Design 
                  team for the Office of Information Technology at the University of Colorado 
                  Boulder. My position has been as a UX/UI Designer working primarily for Buff 
                  Portal, which is the main website that thousands of CU Boulder students use 
                  daily to access all the information they need across the university.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a UX designer I have gained so much experience in the design process; everything 
                  from UX research, to prototyping, iterating, and shipping to the development 
                  team. I have gained great experience in working with a large team of other UX 
                  designers, UX researchers, business analysts, developers, and product managers. 
                  This position has also helped me realize my love for UX design and helping 
                  design the best user experiences possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other than UX design, I am extremely interested in data science. As an 
                  Information Science student, I have developed extensive skills in Python and 
                  performing data analysis, anything from natural language processing to web 
                  scraping. I have brought this analytical mindset into my experience in the UX 
                  field through my work in Google Analytics as well as analyzing qualitative user 
                  feedback data with natural language processing machine learning models.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I pride myself on my curiosity and willingness to learn new 
                  things. I donâ€™t consider myself a software developer but I enjoy 
                  challenging myself with building new things. For example, I 
                  recently designed and coded a new full stack web application, 
                  meaning I had to learn backend development (Django) to build this 
                  application. Additionally, instead of using a typical drag & drop 
                  website builder I wanted to challenge myself by coding this website as 
                  well.
