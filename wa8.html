	<h3>Step One: Code</h3>
	<p>With this data I was interested in determining how arrests, citations, and warnings were shaped by what time of the day the stop occured. To do this I filtered the data by hour of the stop. I determined that a "Late Night" stop was between the hours of 10pm and 3am. I filtered the datapoints to have a True of False value for being "Late_At_Night". I also changed the Boolean values for the arrest, citation, and warning columns to be 1's and 0's so that I could perform some sort of aggregation. To aggregate the data I did a groupby on the "Late_At_Night" column while performing average functions on the arrest, citation, and warning columns so that I could determine what percent of stops led to these outcomes. </p>
