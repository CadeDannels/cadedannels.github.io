  				I read in the data with pandas as a dataframe. After inspecting the data I decided I wanted to look at the birth year data point along with the stoptime data point. Knowing this, I performed a groupby on the data to get the count of how many stops were made by birth year and the average length of stop for that birth year. I did this with the following code:

  			<pre class="line-numbers">
  			<code class="language-python">
    			year_gb = data.groupby("Year_of_birth").agg({"ObjectId":'count', "stoptime":np.mean})
  			</code>
