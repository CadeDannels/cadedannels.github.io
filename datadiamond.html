      </div>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        As an Information Science student, we do a lot of work with a tool called Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis. A lot of 
        people in this major want to go into data science or analysis as a career. However, I noticed that it was hard for these 
        students to find other data analysis projects as inspiration for projects of their own. They needed a place where they could 
        browse other Jupyter Notebooks, see what others have been working on, learn new codes and techniques, and create new projects 
        of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        This led me to think, “hey, I could build that”. Even though I knew this would be a big development project, 
        the biggest I had ever completed, I was determined to give it a shot.
      </p>

      <h3>Initial Design Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        I began brainstorming user needs, features, and initial design directions in Mural. I knew I wanted to center 
        the site around the user experience of browsing Jupyter Notebooks in a seamless way. It also made sense to create a 
        discussion board where users could bring up questions and communicate with one another.
      </p>

      <h3>Development Process</h3>
      <p>
        In no way do I consider myself a full stack engineer. However, I do consider myself one hell of a learner. So I 
        learned from nothing how to code the backend of a website using Django. I had to learn database storage, storing user 
        files on Amazon S3, and creating an application behind user login authentication. Additionally, I learned logo development
        which you can see below.

      </div>

      <h3>User Research</h3>
      <p>
        Once I started to develop base functionality with my app, I met with 2 students in the Information Science 
        department (target users) to get their feedback on the design and user experience. They gave me lots of great feedback such as 
        shortening the landing page, allowing editable comments, and making the login page require email instead of the harder to 
        remember username.
      </p>

      <h3>Shipping an MVP</h3>
      <p>
        If I’ve learned anything from the Agile process it is that it is much better to ship a lower quality product than to 
        ship nothing at all. The key is to ship early, get lots of feedback, and continuously iterate. Fail fast, fail forward 
        mentality. So after only a month of working on the project I decided to ship it and host the product on heroku 
        (another thing I had to learn) and at the domain datadiamond.io.
      </p>

      <h3>Development Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        Let me clarify again that I am not a software engineer. This made it so that I had a lot of compromises I had to make 
        with my design and user experience because I had to focus on larger software features.
      </p>

      <h3>Research and Next Steps</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:5%;">
        After launching the product I reached out to several people on linkedIn and Twitter who I trusted and wanted their 
        opinion of the project. I also posted the project on r/datascience to see what that target audience thought of the app. 
        My main goal for this research was to see if this side project was worthy of me continuing with. I got a lot of great feedback 
        from these approaches, but ultimately decided to stop working on datadiamond. It was a great project that taught me a lot about 
        the development cycle and how to be a design/developer team of one.
