	The <a href="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/what-happened-with-gamestop/">GameStop short squeeze</a> was a massive event in the investing world. It showed that collectively small traders can make a difference. It also showed how powerful social media can truly be, by impacting giant players on Wall Street. As information scientists we realize the implications of social media and these platforms like Wall Street Bets. Before the digital era it was much less accessible for everyday traders to get information on trading strategies. However, now all it takes is a quick google search or a quick check on whatever website/platform a user prefers. As we’ve seen especially in the pandemic, trading has gotten very popular among everyday people. While all of this sounds good, there are obviously some drawbacks. 
</p>
<p>
	I’m no financial advisor but my prediction for what will happen next is that average investors and the people on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">r/WallStreetBets</a> will attempt to replicate what happened with GameStop. They made so much money the first time so why shouldn’t they do it again? However, what happens if/when Wall Street and the big hedge funds win this time? It was one thing for a giant, wealthy hedge fund to lose billions of dollars, but what happens when everyday traders collectively lose this much? This would wreck the lives of thousands of people. However, people do not see that happening right now. Lots of people will want to get in on a piece of the pie and chase the next GameStop, but I’m not sure that will be coming.
</p>
<p>
	Now you might argue that platforms such as Reddit should step in and prevent this collective action from taking place, but this would be impractical. If Reddit or Twitter does this, then the users will just find one of the other infinite amounts of places on the internet to call homebase. This ultimately represents a digital <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-bitcoin-and-qanon-how-the-wisdom-of-crowds-became-the-anarchy-of-the-mob-11611928823?st=jzh5kc9z0v5yxi1">mob mentality</a>. A group rallying together all supporting the same cause hoping to win the battle of Wall Street, with all of them currently riding the high from the huge win with GameStop. That sounds like a dangerous combination if you ask me.

</p>
<p>
	However, what if I’m wrong and r/WallStreetBets continues having massive success? What does this mean for the trading and digital world? Well I would imagine that eventually Wall Street will catch on and even use this to their advantage. Wall Street will use their information science skills and hire analysts to comb through social media data to get insight on what the average day traders are up to. Which will ultimately cancel out any advantage that the users had in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
	While there is no denying that the GameStop short squeeze was a monumental event, I do not imagine that this pattern will continue. Wall Street’s job used to be to outsmart and out invest other players on Wall Street. However, now due to the massive influx of confident everyday traders, Wall Street’s new goal will be to outsmart and out invest these everyday people (as well as the other major players). Wall Street is the king of data and will now begin taking social media data much more seriously. I imagine this means that skills such as <ul>
		<li>natural language processing</li>
		<li>social media API usage</li>
		<li>web scraping</li>
	</ul> will become much more valuable skills on the job market. As information science students we should begin learning these skills and responding to the constant changing tides of where the important data is and how we can analyze it or use it to our advantage.
