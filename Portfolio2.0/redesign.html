	<p>First off, check out my <a href="inspiration.html">Inspiration page</a> to see where I gathered inspiration for this assignment.</p>
	<h3>Home Page</h3>
	<a href="wa5.html">link</a>
	<p class="alignParagraph">
		I redesigned the home page to use Bootstrap columns with my picture on the left column and some brief information on the right. I also used a Bootstrap button that will take you to my About Me page. I also used a Bootstrap navbar that is used on every page that can take you between the links. 
	</p>

	<h3>About Me Page</h3>
	<a href="aboutme.html">link</a>
	<p class="alignParagraph">
		With the About Me page I used Bootstrap columns on the "education" section. On the left I put some information and on the right I list some relevant coursework. Additionally, for these listed courses I used Bootstraps "List Group" functionality to organize them. I also must say that I tried to use Bootstraps "Accordion" component but could not figure out how to make it click responsive. I will try and work on this in the future. 
	</p>

	<h3>Projects Page</h3>
	<a href="portfolio.html">link</a>
	<p class="alignParagraph">
		With the Projects page I used Bootstraps "Card" component to organize the information. The card component allowed me to include a button that links directly to the code on my Github. I also used rows and columns. With this page, each individual project is on its own row with two columns: one for the information card and one for the visualization.
	</p>

	<h3>Contact Page</h3>
	<a href="contact.html">link</a>
	<p class="alignParagraph">
		With the Contact page I changed the LinkedIn and Github basic links to Bootstrap buttons. This allows for a better looking page and a more intutitve process. In the future I will need to keep working on this page because it does currently seem very bland.
	</p>

	<h3>Component Not Used in Class</h3>
	<p class="alignParagraph">
		I am currently making this on Sunday 2/28 so I am not sure what will be covered in class. Everything I used I learned from the documentation. But I would guess that the "List Group" or "Card" components wont be covered in class. With these two components I just combed through the Bootstrap documentation looking for something that could help me present my information in a compelling manner. For the card component for example I copy and pasted the basic Bootstrap syntax from the documentation and then changed what was necessary for me. I changed the link, header, and text to produce the cards that are now on <a href="portfolio.html">my Projects page.</a> This was a simple process because of how well the Bootstrap documentation is setup. I feel comfortable repeating this process with any Bootstrap component in the future.
