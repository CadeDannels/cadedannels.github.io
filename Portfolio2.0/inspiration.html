<p>This website was inspiring to me because I really enjoyed the simplicity of the portfolio. I liked his landing page and how it just had his picture and a brief description of him. I also liked how he put his skills with rankings.</p>

<p>This portfolio was very impressive from beginning to end. I like how he has so many photos of himself that he often uses as a background underneath the text. I was also impressed by how much information he packs into his website. I also liked his "subscribe" section at the bottom that allowed you to easily type in your email to signup for his newsletter. I thought this was a well designed site. Although, he has so much information that it can often feel like too much is going on. The first link did a much better job with keeping the inforamtion brief and the style simplistic.</p>

<p>I liked how this website has a feeling of interactivity. The icons will jiggle when loaded which is a cool feature that makes the site engaging. I also liked his landing page with the picture as the background. Finally, I appreciate how simple and straight to the point the website is. This is a much more realistic website (one that is much easier to recreate myself than the other two). Also, it is hosted on github.io which I thought was worth pointing out.</p>
